# 🏦 Abdullah Banking Service
A complete C# console banking system for international students.

## What My Project Can Do
For my C# final project, I built a complete banking system that does a lot more than just basic banking. Here's a breakdown of everything it has:

**Core Banking Stuff (The Basics):**
- Open a new account with your name and a secret PIN.
- Put money in (deposit) and take money out (withdraw), with all the proper security checks.
- Send money to your friends who also bank with me (transfer).

**The Big Feature: The "Payment Hub"**
This is the part I'm really proud of. I made it so you can pay for almost everything a student in China needs, all from one place:
- **University Bills:** My tuition, dormitory fee, even library charges.
- **Government Stuff:** The visa extension fee, getting a residence permit – all the important (and annoying) paperwork payments.
- **Insurance:** To renew my student medical insurance or get travel insurance for a trip.
- **Top Up My Phone Wallets:** I use Alipay and WeChat Pay every day, so I added a way to put money directly into them.
- **Bills:** For my dorm's electricity, water, and internet.

**Useful Tools I Added:**
- **Currency Exchange:** I set it up to easily switch between Chinese Yuan (CNY), Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), and other currencies because that's what me and my international friends need.
- **Savings Calculator:** To see how much money I could make if I put some in a fixed deposit.
- **Get Official Papers:** The program automatically saves a proper receipt to your computer desktop after every payment or when you want your account statement. It looks very official!

**About the Bank:**
I included all the information about my made-up "Abdullah Banking Service," like its fake address at our Nantong University campus and phone number, to make it feel like a real local bank for students.
